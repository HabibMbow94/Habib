I am **habib Mbow**, I am a student at the African Master in Machine Intelligence.

After a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics in 2018, then a Master's degree in 2020 in Mathematics and Applied Computer Science at the University of Lille, I was able to establish a good foundation around mathematics and its applications including Machine Learning and data analysis. I then followed a training in web development at SIMPLON HAUTS DE FRANCE that I completed with an internship as a Frontend Developer.

Fascinated by AI, I then enrolled in the Master AMMI at AIMS, training built around AI systems for automatic language processing and computer vision among others. In this sense I had to work on several Machine Learning and Deep Learning projects and I have a lot of experience in applying these methods to real problems. Moreover, I had to participate in three Kaggle competitions.

I am looking for opportunities around AI and its applications, especially in the health secto
